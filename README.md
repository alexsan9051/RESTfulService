# RESTfulService
 Employee Timecard Tracking Service

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a RESTful service using Node.js designed to help companies efficiently track employee timecards. The primary objective was to create a reliable system for recording and managing employee timecards efficiently.

## Key Features and Components

### 1. Data Layer Integration

The project seamlessly integrates the provided Data Layer, ensuring the accurate storage and retrieval of timecard data. This foundational component forms the backbone of the service.

### 2. User Authentication

The service incorporates user authentication mechanisms to secure access to timecard information. User accounts are associated with their RIT user IDs, enhancing security and data integrity.

### 3. RESTful API

The core of the project is a RESTful API that enables authorized users to perform various operations related to timecard tracking. This includes creating, updating, and retrieving timecards, as well as managing user accounts.

### 4. Business Layer Validation

Robust validation processes are implemented in the Business Layer to ensure data accuracy and consistency. This validation covers aspects such as timecard entries and user inputs, guaranteeing the integrity of the timecard records.

### 5. Custom Error Handling

The service incorporates custom error handling to provide informative and context-specific error messages. When errors occur, users receive clear and actionable feedback, improving the overall user experience.
